# POC--Binary-Chromosome-for-Genetic-Algorithm
This POC is to demonstrate the metadata based optimized approach for implementing binary chromosomes in Genetic Algorithm.
This would be helpful to reduce the memory consumption.
For simulation purpose a quadratic equation having three independent variables have been used and is referred as 'Function 1'.
