# POC--Binary-Chromosome-for-Genetic-Algorithm
This POC is to demonstrate the metadata based optimized approach for implementing binary chromosomes in Genetic Algorithm as presented in the article https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04751.
For simulation purpose a quadratic equation having three independent variables have been used and is referred as 'Function 1'.
